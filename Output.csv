People get out of your home destroy laws and kill police,1
This is bullshit that cop shouldn't of gotten in trouble,1
Cop is a loser,1
You aree so ugly go die,1
"The cop should have let him go run he's fkn drunk and scared...NOOO,he chases after him knowing damn well he has a taser. So i guess that gives him reason to take a life huh??racist bit#! Shoots him dead then kicks him!.",1
"Hear the cacausions aka clansman argument of a taser with a limited range  vs a gun and bullet proof armor ""he fought the cop he had a taser"" in my opinion the the cop faught him  why didn' he take the key after he parkd the car put him in squad car  and let him call his sister or someone to drive him home ,he could have locked the keys in the car and let him take the bus or walk home the problem is in th culture of these cowards with badge and a gun they have no honor just hate in their blood smh the guy is so called drunk how far could he run is being drunk asleep a crime let's be civil when talking about life . No one was in any danger until the clan showed up one of the bullets should have hit the idiot that think it's ok to fire at someone in public space that's causing 0 threat to life just a little inconvenience of going around him at the drive threw",1
"But why run? I've been pulled over many times for different reasons. I just do what the cops ask, I show them my license and registration, I get out of the car if they ask, I don't try to hit them, shoot them, taze them  or argue with them. And I don't run away. And guess what, they never shot me! So don't do stupid shit and them blame the cops for doing their job.",1
why are you streaming go to hell and die,1
"The police are nothing more than lying criminals who like this shit.  And the municipal courts are what allows them to get away with it because it brings the city/state money.

Ever wonder why the municipal courts (state legal system) seldom brings charges against cops, or the randomly selected (do you really believe that) jury that finds them innocent? Money. Everything in this country is about taking your money.

If the Police were required to have PERSONAL INSURANCE this would all stop because you can be assured the insurance companies would weed out the bad cops, and bad cop behavior (which is all they do) because it would cost the insurance company money.  Could you imagine, instead of tax payers paying for police misconduct lawsuits the insurance companies would have to pay???  Oh things would change quick, and these cops can afford the insurance.  Have you learned what they make???  Way more than you think, or what they would want you to believe.

The police are, or maybe always have been, sooo corrupt.  There was a time when people (me included) looked up to them...now people should only look down on them! They brought this upon themselves through their actions, which cell phones/internet has brought to light. Makes me think this is how it has always been!!!  We just get to see it instead of hearing about it third person which removes the gravity of what is happening. 

I do not think there is a person reading this that won't agree things have changed for the worse (except the blue smurfs that troll these videos to make pigs sound like heroes/victims).  We the people have the power to change things, but if that power is not unified, through voting, protesting or just generally engaging your neighbor to look through YouTube videos (or similar info sources) what is going to change??  You think the cops are miraculously going to better themselves?  Bahahaha

Things need to change and they aren't going to do it on their own.  It's like trying to get a dog that has always been shitting on the rug to suddenly stop.  In this country we have the luxury to speak our opinion and move for change.  I wonder what would people in countries that don't have this option think about us ignoring this right.

Life is understood looking backwards but must be lived looking forward.  Will today's youth understand what life would be like had this generation stood up to tyrants?  Will today's adults look back and think what they could have done to prevent the police state the US is becoming?

All I can say is I am glad I am not a young child who can't even fathom what the future will be like for them and later in life learning how much better things were for us.  What a gift we leave them.

Question everything and challenge authority.  This was the mantra in the 60's people.  How/when did we become so complacent?",1
"So, failed a breath test, struggled...why? then pulls a weapon on the Police. What a dumbass. If black people in the USA stopped being the typical criminals then perhaps the stereotype would fade.",1
They all look So dumb when caught in the actno one there going to be in the cell with somebody black.,1
