Black Crime matter to most of people and your action calls for consequence.This is United State America ruled by the law and order not by your racial victim campaign,,
Well if you guys watch the video he fired the taser and that did not strike anybody which makes the taser useless afterwards. Then the police officer fired shots at him and decided to kick them in the face. With that said he kind of brought this on himself for doing what he did but I can see how they killed him when he was unarmed .,,
"Best way I can describe and conclude this altercation without being biased:
The black guy did take the taser and tried fleeing yes, if the officer felt threatened by it the best thing to do is go for a non lethal kill. My navy training teaching the pyramid of when do use deadly force but a intoxicated man(since he failed the breath test) arguably didn’t know what he was doing for one. Not saying he was in the right cuz he shouldn’t be running away or stealing a taser but the cops could have found a non lethal way of taking him down. Lastly the most disrespectful thing about the altercation is kicking him and not calling for medical. So in conclusion don’t say he deserved to die and it was justified. He definitely made those mistakes by far but killing him and then disrespecting him isn’t justified and if u think it is ur foolish",,
English people are no different,,
People get out of your home destroy laws and kill police,,
I think both sides were in the wrong tbh. I don’t think this has anything to do with race though.,,
"Just curious,   How many of the black men shot by police were actually complying with the police?   I am guessing none.",,
"***NEVER TRUST*** the Authorities
Fight Back (Micha Xavier Johnson/Activist-Texas)",,
Drop the charges against these innocent officers.   Brooks fought them and shot the taser at them.   He absolutely posed a threat to the officers,,
Overseers sad ,,
White cops need to stop patrolling black neighborhoods please. Overseers. For one he was sleeping because he was intoxicated. He did nothing wrong. This cops cover for each other. White cops think it is ok ✅ fuck them,,
Main stream media man it's a joke,,
"Next time, every american with a gun should response with lethal force once confronted by police coz the end game is determined already. It's a fight to survive",,
BBC is fundamentally DISHONEST,,
Swear he shot a taser at the office,,
Fake agenda news!,,
Get rid of these race soldiers now,,
It should be illegal to harassed somebody sleeping in there car.,,
He still kick him after shooting him in the back there'll never stop with white supremacy and the people who defend that type of behavior,,
100% Bullshit Media coverage!   The Cop whom shot is Officer Garrett Rolfe..  The Murder Charges Against Him Have Since Been Dropped!  Garrett Rolfe is Back On-Duty!  :),,
"Respect to the cop, another criminal off the streets!!!!!",,
Maybe…idkkk…don’t run?,,
They found him alseep in a parking lot. If the police weren't dickheads and just decided to negotiable and let the dude walk home or call for a ride this could have been avoided.,,
"This racist KKK cop should be locked up in prison for life and his kids and his grandkids should be locked up in prison for life 
, enough is enough of this racist garbage AND WE ARE NOT AFRICAN WE ARE BLACK AMERICANS, And this country belongs US native American and Mexican people if y’all don’t like it leave.",,
Well done to that cop ,,
How the fuck he was unarmed when he was holding a taser..,,
"This is heartbreaking, but I don't believe this is up to the same level, as we have seen and all of the rest of the cases, as a black man, I am not saying that they were right in any manner, I mean but if he took for the allowed them put rest in him, he had been asleep two hours in the Wendy's drive-thru window, and he wants them to let him go home and take care of a child, and steals their taser and tries to point it at them, that deck that's a gun at the end of the day oh, trust me I know I've been charged will it, they charged me with battery by result of a electronic firearm.",,
"Dude was sleeping in his car.
He wasn't doing anything illegal.

The arrest was unlawful. 
Should he have grabbed the taser? No, but im gonna say the same thing i hear from cop apologists all the time. 

It was a quick split second decision made as he feared for his life. 

But cops will shoot anyone for any reason, well, unless they're murdering kids. Then the cowards stand around with their thumbs up their asses",,
Ur mom bitch,,
Unarmed man had tazer,,
"Shooting is completely justified in this scenario, I don't know why anyone would think you can shoot at cops and get off scot-free. It doesn't matter what weapon he used, he could've been throwing rocks at them, it is an assault on an officer and they can use lethal force to defend themselves. 
The troubling part here is what they did after, kicking him while he is lying down and refusing to give him CPR. I would like to see body-worn camera though and hear what exactly were they saying at that moment.
Seems like a situation where everyone involved has severe behavioral problems.
The title says ""unarmed black man"" just to polarize the audience even further.",,
He got what he deserved if only they would listen this would’ve never happened,,
two punks who are addicted to call of duty,,
tall nigga,,
Black people fear for their life against the white cops don't you know that don't you know every time you turn around white police officers killed black Americans are you serious,,
"since when does a taser kill someone smh

how many time has a cop tased or shot someone

fear his life of a taser hilarious",,
This is bullshit that cop shouldn't of gotten in trouble,,
Get a new job scum. The BBC is no where yo give anyone news!,,
"No murder here, resisting arrest and pointing a taser at a police officer, this is lawful.",,
Cop is a loser,,
The BBC News is basically like NPR liberal agenda,,
A black could be in the middle of raping a child and they would still find a way to blame everyone but the blacks.,,
undisciplined Americans. no discipline in life no moral.,,
"Why do you fight back, if you cared about your daughter and family you would of complied",,
"My rage is not that they shot ""a black man"" in the back it's they shot a man in the back pure and simple... The color of someone skin doesn't matter.. they shot a min that showed no real threat and found reason to escalate a situation that could have bin as simple as oh ok we just wanted to make sure you weren't dead in the car oh your dunk cool are you planning on staying here cool you got warrants no?? Cool ok I'll let you get back to sleep so you can wake up SOBER and live your life..... They did not do this they unnecessary and intentionally put themselves and a now dead man in harms way. This happens to me all the time and what they did was not the way you protect your people regardless of his or her (or those who wish not to self identity)  ethnic origin or religious background the hole black vs white that is WAY beyond the point the point is YOU treated a living being in such a manner without even at least putting in medical attention witch would have bin even a little more acceptable then what the entire video shows they look like they were playing lazer tag with a man that even with a tazer running from you to get away to live to be free and you denied him that HUMAN RIGHT not just the camstitutional right that we made but and actual human right.... humans without humanity make me sick homie. My dark dead beating heart goes out to this man who probably had everything taken from him just before the incident with the police officers his kids birthday and he sleeping in his car come on man what the hell are you doing with your life to do that to that man....",,
it's sad that cops doing their job get charged for sh3t reasons,,
bro he did justice,,
Not guilty,,
You aree so ugly go die,,
The Cops did nothing wrong.  They were attacked while doing their job and neutralized the threat.  Time to get real people.  Take the handcuffs off the cops and put them on the criminals!,,
To the people who didn't watch the video: No one thinks the cop wasn't justified in shooting him. He absolutely was. Its what happened after that that's the problem.,,
Black police officers should maybe enforce the law and hold their white colleagues accountable for their misconduct concerning race and stop trying to be uncle ruckus.,,
Kill em all,,
He caused his own death. He created the situation and the officer did not do any wrong!!!,,
Shut the fuck up bitch,,
love seeing cops kill criminals,,
Pimp,,
Yes this is absolutely heartbreaking among many many more but I did see a video where two cops tased an autistic kid in the shower 22 times and killed him know that may be really sick,,
"I’ve been kicked and punched, decked, spit on. I fought back. I won some. A lost one. Never shot anyone!!!!!",,
its sickening how people are defending criminals and charge the officer when their weapon are clearly snatched and point back at them,,
"Zechariah 11:5-7

"The cop should have let him go run he's fkn drunk and scared...NOOO,he chases after him knowing damn well he has a taser. So i guess that gives him reason to take a life huh??racist bit#! Shoots him dead then kicks him!.",,
Racist people,,
his ass looks now like a donut,,
Sucker ,,
"so you can not be drunk and sleep in your car. Got it. 
Another list of things that a coloured person can not do.",,
"why they are trained to shoot only above waist or direct to chest.
shooting on a leg is enough.",,
RACIST IN UNIFORM WILL NEVER CHANGE!,,
The officer did nothing wrong. The Black guy resisted. He fought the cop. He attempted to taser the cop. Black people are simply too impulsive. They don't think. They just react.,,
I always wondered how guilty police go home and face there family,,
Come suck my …,,
Both of the cops should be stuck on the electric chair pieces of garbage God bless to all of the amazing police officers out there but these two are definitely garbage ignorance,,
"Taser vs guns wow they could have drove him home but that would be too kind I guess only a peace officer would have that power , police are there to enforce Jim crow and to steel from the poor to give to the rich 😉",,
"Hear the cacausions aka clansman argument of a taser with a limited range  vs a gun and bullet proof armor ""he fought the cop he had a taser"" in my opinion the the cop faught him  why didn' he take the key after he parkd the car put him in squad car  and let him call his sister or someone to drive him home ,he could have locked the keys in the car and let him take the bus or walk home the problem is in th culture of these cowards with badge and a gun they have no honor just hate in their blood smh the guy is so called drunk how far could he run is being drunk asleep a crime let's be civil when talking about life . No one was in any danger until the clan showed up one of the bullets should have hit the idiot that think it's ok to fire at someone in public space that's causing 0 threat to life just a little inconvenience of going around him at the drive threw",,
"But why run? I've been pulled over many times for different reasons. I just do what the cops ask, I show them my license and registration, I get out of the car if they ask, I don't try to hit them, shoot them, taze them  or argue with them. And I don't run away. And guess what, they never shot me! So don't do stupid shit and them blame the cops for doing their job.",,
You are so bad man u suck ballsack,,
Hey mfucker suck my cock,,
BBC News gets it wrong again,,
Suck my cock daddy,,
black men die aooooooo mother of God yes sir ree that was a great shot nice video horror movies,,
"Stop resisting, almost all of these so called racial arrests always involve some form of resistance.  You resist and take away a officers  tazor it can then be used on the officer. Which in turn can subdue the cop whereas the assailant can possibly grab the officers 👮‍♀️ gun and kill him and others. So the moral is stop RESISTING.  Only reason to resist or run away is possibly more warrants etc or probation.",,
why are you streaming go to hell and die,,
Get lost bbc and cops kill them all ..racist  scum,,
How about we do the same to them make them run and shoot them in the back then kick them sounds like justice to me,,
"The police are nothing more than lying criminals who like this shit.  And the municipal courts are what allows them to get away with it because it brings the city/state money.

Ever wonder why the municipal courts (state legal system) seldom brings charges against cops, or the randomly selected (do you really believe that) jury that finds them innocent? Money. Everything in this country is about taking your money.

If the Police were required to have PERSONAL INSURANCE this would all stop because you can be assured the insurance companies would weed out the bad cops, and bad cop behavior (which is all they do) because it would cost the insurance company money.  Could you imagine, instead of tax payers paying for police misconduct lawsuits the insurance companies would have to pay???  Oh things would change quick, and these cops can afford the insurance.  Have you learned what they make???  Way more than you think, or what they would want you to believe.

The police are, or maybe always have been, sooo corrupt.  There was a time when people (me included) looked up to them...now people should only look down on them! They brought this upon themselves through their actions, which cell phones/internet has brought to light. Makes me think this is how it has always been!!!  We just get to see it instead of hearing about it third person which removes the gravity of what is happening. 

I do not think there is a person reading this that won't agree things have changed for the worse (except the blue smurfs that troll these videos to make pigs sound like heroes/victims).  We the people have the power to change things, but if that power is not unified, through voting, protesting or just generally engaging your neighbor to look through YouTube videos (or similar info sources) what is going to change??  You think the cops are miraculously going to better themselves?  Bahahaha

Things need to change and they aren't going to do it on their own.  It's like trying to get a dog that has always been shitting on the rug to suddenly stop.  In this country we have the luxury to speak our opinion and move for change.  I wonder what would people in countries that don't have this option think about us ignoring this right.

Life is understood looking backwards but must be lived looking forward.  Will today's youth understand what life would be like had this generation stood up to tyrants?  Will today's adults look back and think what they could have done to prevent the police state the US is becoming?

All I can say is I am glad I am not a young child who can't even fathom what the future will be like for them and later in life learning how much better things were for us.  What a gift we leave them.

Question everything and challenge authority.  This was the mantra in the 60's people.  How/when did we become so complacent?",,
Come on! I’m pretty positive no cop has ever gotten the death penalty for an on duty shooting....,,
The police officer was right,,
Get lost nigga,,
Wtf is wrong with you Lstreamer,,
Race has noting to do with this and he was not unarmed please get your facts correct,,
"So, failed a breath test, struggled...why? then pulls a weapon on the Police. What a dumbass. If black people in the USA stopped being the typical criminals then perhaps the stereotype would fade.",,
SMH. You are nothing! You are a back shooter;  a  coward! We don't need you! Try that in another country; try that in Iraq 🇮🇶... you'll never see home again.. f### you!,,
"Taser is not a deadly weapon....American police is so good at shooting unarmed people whenever they want, but when it comes to armed individual who killed 19 children and two of their teachers at Uvalde elementary school, they took their sweet time... 379 of them, armed to their teeth, with all protective equipment they had, took them 79 minutes to kill ONE individual with a gun, who killed 19 innocent kids, yes 79 minutes, yes one hour and 20 minutes. There was no rogue detective kicking doors like you see in the Hollywood movies, no SWAT team jumping through windows, they just sit there for 79 minutes, waiting and waiting allowing the gunman to kill more, allowing the victims to die. 379 fully armed, fully protected, against one crazy individual with gun. do you know what make this incident even more shameful for US police??? during the ordeal, one mother took the opportunity and ran inside the school and saved her child while the other 379 armed officers were just standing there and watching. She was not armed, she had no protection like the other 379 officers but she was not a coward unlike the other 379 police officers, Marshals, detectives, Special operation unit members and armed border control officers who took their sweet time to deal with the situation as they should. It is protecting and serving but I wonder who are they protecting, and whom they are serving. Watching these kind of videos make me sick to my stomach.",,
They all look So dumb when caught in the actno one there going to be in the cell with somebody black.,,
Our cops are the best,,
You have the story all wrong.....these aren't the true facts.,,
